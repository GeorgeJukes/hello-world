# hello-world
A test repository (I'm new)
I'm new to GitHub and very eager to learn stuff. 
I've done amateur coding in the past, but I've decided to now fully commit myself to it.
It's also worth noting that I like ducks and squirrels. They are good animals. I think...
I hope to enjoy this place and learn new things!
